# Contributing

:wave: Hi there!

We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is
essential for keeping it great.

## Submitting a pull request

We use [pull requests][open-prs] to contribute new features, fixes, or
documentation.

[open-prs]: https://github.com/notorious-go/sync/pulls

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull
request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
  would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, submit them as
  separate pull requests.
- Write [descriptive commit messages][commit-format]. Review the Git history to
  get a feel for it.

[commit-format]: https://go.dev/wiki/CommitMessage

Draft pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is
something blocking you.
